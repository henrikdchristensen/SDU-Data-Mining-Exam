    This paper presents a comparative analysis of three subspace clustering algorithms: CLIQUE, MAFIA, and SUBCLU with main focus on MAFIA. Their scalability, clustering quality, and sensitivity to parameters are investigated. MAFIA, with its adaptive grid approach, demonstrates the highest scalability for large datasets. CLIQUE, while also scalable, struggles with clustering quality, especially in complex datasets where grid size is not well-tuned. SUBCLU, utilizing a density-connected approach, excels at identifying arbitrarily shaped clusters but incurs a higher computational cost. The study underscores that all three clustering algorithms need proper parameter tuning and the choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements and case of use.
